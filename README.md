## Planning Analysis Sheet
### Website goal
    To create website based on the sport sailing and white sails racing. I want to design the site around encouraging people to have a go at sailing by providing different ways and opportunities to do so on the site. 

## List the working title of each page on your site.
### Home
    This will have some info about the site. I also want to add a weather and tide widget to this page as this is what is usually looked at first on a sailing site. There will also be a video of a race event. Gride layout with 3 columns and 3 rows but may add more rows if needed. There should also be a 'mailto' link in the welcome note for more info.
    
### Join a Crew 
    There will be a motivational message here to hook potential crew. There will also be a form that interested parties can fill out to be matched with a suitable crew.

### Courses
    This page will have a table with some sailing courses. The last column should have external links for more information. The links also should use transforms.

### Upcoming Events
    The page has another table with upcoming sailing events and races.

### Gallery
    The site has a Gallery page using a grid display. Images transform scale when pointer hovers over. 

## List of sources
### Images
    Three images are from Kling AI 
    https://klingai.com/
    
    All other images are my own.
### Video 
    The video used is from WIORA (West of Ireland Offshore Racing Association) 2019 and can be found on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkElwdcv3yc

### Widgets
    The weather widget used is from weatherwidget.org: https://weatherwidget.org
    The tide widget used is from Tide Times: https://www.tidetimes.org.uk

### Logo
    The logo was created in PowerPoint.

## SEO Features
    I used meta-keywords and sitemap.xml
